<div class="entry-content"><p>In early 2012, between when I applied for colleges and when I accepted one of
them, I was invited to apply for <a href="https://cse.wwu.edu/cs/computer-sciencemath-scholars-program">a scholarship and mentoring program</a>
at WWU for women in computer science and math. Now, having been part of that
program for a couple years and already fairly close to graduating, I&rsquo;m
overwhelmingly thankful for the opportunities it&rsquo;s given me.</p>

<p>These were my answers to the questions I was asked when I applied.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>Why do you want to major in computer science or math?</strong></p>

<p>I have had a lifelong affinity for computers and math, as well as for helping
people, so it should come as no surprise to you that I&rsquo;ve always been the go-to
girl for computer and math help. As early as elementary school, teachers asked
for my assistance with finicky computers rather than waiting for the district
tech support, and they rarely bothered making answer keys for math homework
since they knew they could use my paper instead. This naturally made me quite
popular among my classmates as well, though I always did my best to help them
learn the concepts, not just give them answers. These talents have continued
throughout my life in school, though I hadn&rsquo;t until recently considered math or
computers as a career. My perspective has changed, however, as the constant news
about security breaches and other attacks on computer systems has grown to a
fever pitch over the last year. Previously, I wanted to be a linguist or
musician; my computer skills were more of a hobby than a professional interest.
Being self-aggrandizing makes me feel sick to my stomach, but I recognize that
for most people &mdash; even most computer people &mdash; information security is not a
strong or enjoyable subject like it is for me! I wholeheartedly feel that it is
my duty to work at defending our nation against computer attackers, whether for
national security or the economy, because of my unusual combination of aptitude
and interest in the field. Pursuing a computer science major is an essential
step toward that goal.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think makes you a successful student?</strong></p>

<p>I am a successful student because I have high standards for myself and I&rsquo;m not
afraid of hard work. Some might say that I&rsquo;m motivated by a fear of failure, and
perhaps that&rsquo;s true &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t care whether it is or isn&rsquo;t. Where others
experience fear, I see an opportunity to get the gears of my mind whirring and a
powerful incentive to find a correct (or acceptable) solution. So while many
people experience stage fright before a musical performance or test anxiety
before a big exam, my strategy is to ignore any sense of fear I do notice
creeping up on me, since I see it crippling others so often, and throw all I can
at the situation. If I did feel any fear in the first place, it flees in terror
of my indomitable force when I&rsquo;m fully prepared!</p>

<p>My eagerness at tackling daunting challenges and my sheer joy when I succeed
motivate me to expect nothing less of myself than my best effort. I know that,
within reason, I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, and I refuse
to let anyone or anything dissuade me. That being said, my close familiarity
with my track record means that I judge myself far more harshly than anyone else
does (except maybe religious fundamentalists &mdash; but that&rsquo;s another story).
However, since I am my own toughest critic, I have the confidence to pursue my
goals without tiptoeing around or cowering from others&#8217; disapproval. I owe my
success to my self-assurance and my work ethic.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond your academic record, tell us more about you.</strong></p>

<p>There are a great many uncommon activities I take pleasure in, from belting out
a sax cadenza in front of several hundred people, to gleefully persuading my car
to coast at the speed limit for half a mile, to programming miniature LED raves.
However, there isn&rsquo;t much short of firewalls or differentiation that gratifies
me more than crocheting and cooking. Just the other day, I finally completed
crocheting a large afghan, using over 1.6 miles of yarn (costing about $25) in
total. It was truly an exercise in perseverance, but it paid off! I remember
when I first started the project last July and I took it camping to pass the
time; it seemed so overwhelming. I knew I could get away with just stopping then
and leaving it as a scarf with an odd pattern, but I&rsquo;m so glad now that I pushed
onward and finished. It&rsquo;s a great companion on cold evenings, and my cats seem
to agree!</p>

<p>Another activity I enjoy far more than I should be allowed to is cooking. It
seems that many people view cooking as a chore to be avoided whenever possible,
but I feel that food nourishes the soul as well as the body. So while I
know that frying some rice or putting together a soup will take half an hour
longer than pouring a pile of Cheez-Its, I also feel that creating a healthy
meal out of real food is worth it for the satisfaction and fulfillment. Coaxing
a pizza to emerge from flour, tomatoes, and cheese, for example, is far more
rewarding than just ordering one anyway! Between crocheting and cooking, I not
only save bucketloads of money versus buying finished products, but in
exercising my creativity, I also mold myself into more of a well-rounded person.</p>
